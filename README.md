# Employee Attrition & Performance Analytics (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyses employee attrition, demographics, and performance data using Power BI to uncover key workforce trends and retention risks.  
The dashboard is designed to support HR and People Analytics decision-making by identifying *who is leaving, where risks are concentrated, and why employees may disengage*.

## 🎯 Key Business Questions
- Which employee groups experience the highest attrition?
- How does attrition vary by age, department, and job role?
- Do stock options help reduce employee attrition?
- How has job satisfaction evolved over time?
- Are performance ratings aligned with job satisfaction?
